The usual pattern is that 80% of the the time is spend in 20% of the code, so you can focus your efforts accordingly. Also, remember that correctness is more important than speed!</p><p>
<A NAME="Profiling"></A>
</p><h2>Profiling your code<a name="3"></a></h2><p>Matlab has an excellent profiler, which can tell you how much time your code spends in each one of its functions. It automatically generates a web page summarizing the results, which you can click on to 'drill down'. See the example below.</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="profile.png" alt=""> </p><p>The report shows a breakdown of all the functions called from your function, the number of times they were called, and the total time spent executing them. Self-time, denoted by a dark blue band, is the the time spent within a function not including how long was spent in functions called from here. This is really the statistic you should pay attention to. You can click on a function name to bring up its sourcecode.</p><p>You can turn on profiling with the <b>profile on</b> command and turn it off again with <b>profile off</b>. Once profiling is on, execute your code, and then type <b>profile viewer</b> to see the report.</p><h2>Timing code<a name="6"></a></h2><p>The profiler tells you where all the time is being spent, but maybe you just want to know how much time your code is taking. The simplest way to time code is to call <b>tic</b> before your code starts and <b>toc</b> afterwards. A more reliable method is the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18798">timeit</a> function, which calls tic/toc multiple times and averages. Matlab used to have a flops command, but it was removed. Tom Minka has written some flop counting routines as part of his <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/minka/software/lightspeed/">lightspeed package</a>.</p><h2>Progress bar<a name="7"></a></h2><p>We can print a graphical bar that indicates how long a certain operation has taken/ will take, as in this example.</p><pre class="codeinput">w = waitbar(0,<span class="string">'My Progress Bar'</span>);                       <span class="comment">% create a new waitbar, w with 0% progress</span>

<A NAME="prealloc"></A>
</p><h2>Memory preallocation<a name="10"></a></h2><p>Matlab stores matrices in contiguous blocks of memory. When the size of a matrix changes, Matlab, if it has not preallocated enough space, must find a new chunk of memory large enough and copy the matrix over. When a matrix grows inside of a loop, this process may have to be repeated over and over again causing huge delays. It can therefore significantly speed up your code by preallocating a chunk of memory before entering into a loop. The <i>zeros()</i> command is the most common way to do this. Below we see two simple loops in which we store the numbers 1 to 30 000. We preallocate only in the second. Timing the two loops with the <i>tic()</i> and <i>toc()</i> commands we see that preallocating in this case speeds up the code by about 30 times. The larger the matrices, the more important this becomes.</p><pre class="codeinput">tic

<A NAME="Vectorization"></A>
</p><h2>Vectorization<a name="14"></a></h2><p>Vectorization is the process of making your code work on array-structured data in parallel, rather than using for-loops. This can make your code much faster and is an essential skill to learn. We give various examples below which should give you some good idioms to copy. Many more examples can be found <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1100/1109.html">here</a>.</p><h2>Using built-in functions which are vectorized<a name="15"></a></h2><p>Most functions in Matlab are already vectorized. For example, to take the log of every number in an array A,  we simply execute B = log(A). Let us compare this vectorized version to calling log on each element.</p><pre class="codeinput">A = rand(200,200);                    <span class="comment">% We will use this as our data</span>
</pre><p><b>non-vectorized version</b></p><pre class="codeinput">tic                                   <span class="comment">% time the code</span>

<span class="keyword">for</span> i=1:size(A,1)
    <span class="keyword">for</span> j=1:size(A,2);

Bv = log(A);
vec = toc;
assert(isequal(Bnv,Bv));
ratio = nonvec / vec
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ratio =
   34.5092
</pre><p>Some functions, like <i>mvnpdf()</i> for example, interpret an n-by-d matrix, not as n-times-d elements but as n, d-dimensional vectors. If this is not what we are after, we can convert the matrix into a vector using the (:) operator, pass it to the function, and reshape the output back into the original size with the <i>reshape()</i> function.</p><h2>Logical indexing.<a name="20"></a></h2><p>Here we see the benefit of logical indexing in making code shorter, faster and easier to read.</p><p><b>non-vectorized version</b></p><pre class="codeinput">tic

</pre><h2>A slightly more complex example of vectorization<a name="23"></a></h2><p>Here we perform three tricks at once as it were. Recall that operators such as ^, \, have  element-wise equivalents, (e.g. .^), which we can apply to the corresponding elements of two same-sized matrices. Secondly, Matlab performs automatic scalar expansion in expressions like <b>A+1</b>, and thirdly, we can easily multiply two matrices together without loops. Most loops involving patterned additions and multiplications of vector elements can be translated, with a little thought, into equivalent <i>vectorized</i> statements.</p><p><b>non-vectorized version</b></p><pre class="codeinput">tic

<a name="bsxfun"></a>
</p><h2>Bsxfun<a name="28"></a></h2><p>One often finds it necessary to subtract say a row vector from a matrix, (e.g. perhaps you want to standardize your data). Since the row vector is neither a scalar, nor the same size as the matrix, Matlab will not let you do this directly. One option is to use the <i>repmat()</i> function we saw earlier to replicate the vector so that it is the same size as the matrix and then subtract. However, a better option is to use the <i>bsxfun()</i> function (bsx stands for binary singleton expansion). You must first specify the operation you wish to perform preceded by the @ symbol. Typical choices include @minus, @plus, @times, @rdivide (however, any binary function can be used - type <b>doc bsxfun</b> for a list). Next the arguments to the function are specified, beginning with the argument whose size does not need to be changed: bsxfun then expands any singleton dimensions in the third argument to the correct size. This function supports multidimensional arrays.</p><pre class="codeinput">A = meshgrid(1:6,1:5)'

% can make a big difference to the speed of your matlab code.
% We discuss some of these below.
%% The danger of premature optimization
% Before spending a lot of time optimizing

%%
% The report shows a breakdown of all the functions called from your
% function, the number of times they were called, and the total time spent
% executing them. Self-time, denoted by a dark blue band, is the the time
% spent within a function not including how long was spent in functions
% called from here. This is really the statistic you should pay attention
% to. You can click on a function name to bring up its sourcecode.
%
% You can turn on profiling with the *profile on* command and turn it off
% again with *profile off*. Once profiling is on, execute your code, and
% then type *profile viewer* to see the report.

%% Timing code
% The profiler tells you where all the time is being spent,

% The simplest way to time code is to call *tic* before your code

%% Progress bar
% We can print a graphical bar that indicates how long
% a certain operation has taken/ will take,
% as in this example.
%%
w = waitbar(0,'My Progress Bar');                       % create a new waitbar, w with 0% progress
for i=1:500

% preallocate only in the second. Timing the two loops with the _tic()_ and
% _toc()_ commands we see that preallocating in this case speeds up the
% code by about 30 times. The larger the matrices, the more important this
% becomes.

%% Vectorization
% Vectorization is the process of making your code work
% on array-structured data in parallel, rather than using for-loops.
% This can make your code much faster and is an essential
% skill to learn.
% We give various examples below which should give you some
% good idioms to copy.
% Many more examples can be found
% <http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1100/1109.html here>.
%% Using built-in functions which are vectorized
% Most functions in Matlab are already vectorized. For example, to take the
% log of every number in an array A,  we simply execute B =
% log(A). Let us compare this vectorized version
% to calling log on each element.
%%

for i=1:size(A,1)

% Some functions, like _mvnpdf()_ for example, interpret an n-by-d
% matrix, not as n-times-d elements but as n, d-dimensional vectors. If
% this is not what we are after, we can convert the matrix into a vector 
% using the (:) operator, pass it to the function, and reshape the output
% back into the original size with the _reshape()_ function.

% in making code shorter, faster and easier to read.

%% A slightly more complex example of vectorization
% Here we perform three tricks at once as it were. Recall that operators
% such as ^, \, have  element-wise equivalents, (e.g. .^), which we can
% apply to the corresponding elements of two same-sized matrices. Secondly,
% Matlab performs automatic scalar expansion in expressions like *A+1*, and
% thirdly, we can easily multiply two matrices together without loops. Most
% loops involving patterned additions and multiplications of vector
% elements can be translated, with a little thought, into equivalent 
% _vectorized_ statements.

%% Bsxfun
% One often finds it necessary to subtract say a row vector from a matrix,
% (e.g. perhaps you want to standardize your data). Since the row vector is
% neither a scalar, nor the same size as the matrix, Matlab will not let
% you do this directly. One option is to use the _repmat()_ function we saw
% earlier to replicate the vector so that it is the same size as the matrix
% and then subtract. However, a better option is to use the _bsxfun()_
% function (bsx stands for binary singleton expansion).
% You must first specify the operation you wish to perform
% preceded by the @ symbol. Typical choices include @minus, @plus, @times,
% @rdivide (however, any binary function can be used - type *doc bsxfun*
% for a list). Next the arguments to the function are specified, beginning
% with the argument whose size does not need to be changed: bsxfun then
% expands any singleton dimensions in the third argument to the correct
% size. This function supports multidimensional arrays. 
A = meshgrid(1:6,1:5)'
B = A - repmat(mean(A,1),size(A,1),1);     % center each column
C = bsxfun(@minus, A, mean(A,1))           % center each column (the better way)
check = isequal(B,C)
D =  bsxfun(@rdivide,A,sqrt(sum(A.^2,1)))  % make each column have unit norm

% and leave our 'non-vectorized' version at least somewhat vectorized to

%% Example using mat2cell and cellfun
% Suppose we have a large numeric matrix and we want to apply a function to
% arbitrary sized blocks of it. That is, we want to partition a matrix of
% size m-by-n into many smaller matrices of differing sizes, apply a
% function to each block, and group the results back together. We could
% extract each block first with a long series of indexing operations and
% then loop over them all applying the function, but there is better way
% involving the _mat2cell()_ and _cellfun()_ functions,
% discussed in <dataStructures.html#cellArrays this section>
%
%%
A = rand(100,40);                               % here is our data
%%
% Partition the matrix into 12 blocks of different sizes. These blocks are
% stored in a 4x3 cell array. Notice the sizes of each of the 12 blocks and
% how we achieved these sizes with the inputs to _mat2cell()_. 
groups = mat2cell(A,[10,30,20,40],[5,27,8])
%%
% Create a function to apply to each block; we will choose something simple
% like replacing each element in a block with the block's largest value. 
f = @(x)repmat(max(x(:)),size(x));
%%
% Use the _cellfun()_ function to apply this function to every one of the
% 12 elements in _groups_, (i.e. to every matrix block). We have to set
% 'UniformOutput' to false because the sizes of the elements returned by
% _cellfun()_ will be different. 
groupSums = cellfun(f,groups,'UniformOutput',false)
%%
% We then convert back to a numeric matrix with the same size as our
% original matrix A.
B = cell2mat(groupSums);
%%
% See also the *filter2* command.
% If you have the image processing toolbox,
% check out the *blkproc* and *im2col* commands, which are similar.
%% More speedup tips
%
% In the last example, we used _cellfun()_ function but there is a similar
% function _arrayfun()_ that applies a function to every element of an
% array. When other _vectorization_ techniques fail, this can be a better
% alternative than looping over every element yourself. 
%
%%
% The _vectorize()_ function takes in a string or function handle and
% converts all operators, (e.g ^) to their element-wise equivalents, (e.g.
% .^). This can be useful when using someone else's function that was not
% vectorized to begin with. 
%%
% Recall from the matrix chapter that there are many functions that will
% create matrices for such as _meshgrid()_, or _blkdiag()_, yet again 
% helping us avoid loops.
%%
% When a value vec(i) depends on on entries v(1)...v(i-1) for instance,
% we can use functions like _cumsum()_, _cumprod()_, _filter()_, _conv()_, 
% and _accumarray()_. See their help entries for more information.

%% Compiling matlab
% Details on how to compile matlab
% to standalone code, using mcc,
% can be found <external.html#mcc here>.
% Note, however, that this does not usually result in a speed increase:
% the purpose of mcc is to make code that can run without matlab,
% which it does by generating byte code which is interpreted
% by a matlab virtual machine.
%%
% There is a method called <external.html#emlmex emlmex>
% that does give speedups, but only for a very narrow
% set of functions. In particular, every time the size
% of the memory footprint of the function changes,
% it must be recompiled.
%%
% The only way to get really big speedup is to
% implement your code in  another language like C, compile
% it with mex, and then call
% that code from within your Matlab program. For details, 
% click <external.html#mex here>.
