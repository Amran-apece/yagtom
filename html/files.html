</pre><h2>Private Functions<a name="14"></a></h2><p>Matlab searches for functions on the <a href="files.html#MatlabPath">matlab path</a>. It is possible to hide functions so they are not globally visible. There are two main mechanisms: private functions and packages. We will say more about private functions in the <a href="objectOriented.html">object oriented programming chapter</a>. However, they can be used in non-OO code as well. Any functions you save into a directory named <i>private</i> will only be accessible by functions in the containing directory one level up (or the private directory itself). Thus, you can create functions with common names like sum or display, put them into a private directory and you will not interfere with existing implementations outside of your project.</p><p>
<A NAME="Packages"></a>
</p><h2>Packages (2008a)<a name="16"></a></h2><p>Packages can be used to partition the name space, which means that functions (or <a href="ObjectOriented.html">classes</a>) of the same name will not clash with each other. Packages are directories beginning with the '+' symbol. Any functions (or classes) you place into these directories are then only accessible by first referring  to the package name. Suppose I create a directory called '+lab' and put the function 'calc' into this directory. I would then call it with the syntax <b>lab.calc()</b> .</p><p>Packages can provide an easy way to organize your code and like private directories, let you reuse common function names. You can temporarily import a package, (meaning you do not have to use the dot syntax) with the import command, i.e. by calling say <b>import lab</b> .</p><p>As of 2008b, the only built-in package (that I am aware of) is <b>containers</b>, which contains a class called <b>map</b> which implements a hash table. Click <a href="dataStructures.html#Containers.map">here</a> for details.</p><h2>Startup File<a name="17"></a></h2><p>You can specify commands to execute every time Matlab starts by creating a file on the Matlab search path with the name <b>startup.m</b> and writing the commands there. On systems running Windows XP, you can store the file in a place such as 'C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2008a\bin'. For example, my startup.m file contains the following:</p><pre class="codeinput">cd <span class="string">C:\kmurphy\webMirror\matlabTutorial\source\matlabTutorial</span>
addpath(genpath(pwd))
format <span class="string">compact</span>
dbstop <span class="string">if</span> <span class="string">error</span>
</pre><p>The first line goes to the specified directory. The second line adds all subdirectories below the current one to the path. The third line reduces the amount of white space used to display matlab output. The fourth line enters the <a href="debugProfileStyle.html#Debugging">debugger</a> if there is an error.</p><h2>Preferences<a name="20"></a></h2><p>Instead of creating a startup.m file, you can edit properties under <b>File-&gt;Preferences</b>. For example, the equivalent of typing 'format compact' is to select <b>File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Command Window-&gt;Text Display-&gt;Numeric display-&gt;compact</b>. Also, you can edit <b>File-&gt;Set Path</b> to add directories to your path. Once you have edited your path in this way, the relevant directories will be automatically added every time you run matlab.</p><h2>Running Matlab in Batch Mode<a name="21"></a></h2><p>Matlab can be run in batch mode, specifying commands for it to execute as soon as it begins, with the <b>-r "command"</b> switch. Commands are separated via semicolons and can be listed directly, or placed in a file with a <b>.m</b> extension and called like this: <b>Matlab -r "myscript"</b>. To write the output to a file, include the following switch: <b>-logfile "logfilename"</b>. If you want Matlab to quit when its finished executing the script, add the <b>exit</b> command at the end. Make sure Matlab can find the m-file you are trying to execute by placing it somewhere on the Matlab path. You can get rid of the opening splash screen with <b>-nosplash</b> and on unix systems bring up a Matlab command window right at the command prompt with the <b>-nodesktop</b> switch.</p><h2>File Input &amp; Output<a name="22"></a></h2><p>Input and output in Matlab is relatively easy and can be done with a few useful functions.

%% Filing system issues
% In this chapter, we discuss issues related to finding and loading/ saving files
% and data.
%% Changing directories
% You can change directory using the *cd* command

%%
% Inside the editor, The _current directory_ window, unsurprisingly, displays the files in the
% current working directory. You can open it via the drop down menu

%% Matlab Path and Search Order
% Matlab finds the functions you call by searching the Matlab Path in the

% If multiple functions with the same name exist on the path,
% the version associated with the end of the pathlist is used.
% The easiest way to add

%%
%pathtool;                           % launch the path tool
addpath(pwd);         % add current directory to the path (done by default)
%%
% We can use the _genpath()_ function to build a string containing the

%%
addpath(genpath(pwd)); % add all directories below current working directory
%%
% Sometimes we want to exclude certain directories, like CVS or SVN,
% or those containing the string 'old'.
% The function <mfiles/genpathPMTK.m genpathPMTK> acts like genpath,
% but excludes such undesirable directories.
addpath(genpathPMTK(pwd)); % add all directories below current working directory
%%
% When multiple files with the same name exist on the Matlab
% path, Matlab silently executes the one higher up on the path. You can
% check which version will be executed with the _which()_ command. 
%%
which exp                           % which implementation will be used
%%
which -all exp;                     % names of all implementations
%% Userpath
% Matlab automatically sets up a default directory where you can save your
% own Matlab files; it opens  this directory, whenever its started. You can
% view and change this default by typing *userpath* or say *userpath
% c:\Users\matt\Matlab\* at the command prompt. 
a = userpath                     % display,(or change) default save directory
%% Private Functions
% Matlab searches for functions on the <files.html#MatlabPath matlab path>.
% It is possible to hide functions so they are not globally visible.
% There are two main mechanisms: private functions and packages.
% We will say more about private functions in the
% <objectOriented.html object
% oriented programming chapter>. However, they can be used in non-OO code as
% well. Any functions you save into a directory named _private_ will only
% be accessible by functions in the containing directory one level up (or
% the private directory itself). Thus, you can create functions with common
% names like sum or display, put them into a private directory and you will
% not interfere with existing implementations outside of your project.

% <html> 
% <A NAME="Packages"></a>
% </html>
%% Packages (2008a)
% Packages can be used to 
% partition the name space,
% which means that functions (or <ObjectOriented.html classes>)
% of the same name will not clash with each other.
% Packages are directories beginning with the '+'
% symbol. Any functions (or classes) you place into these directories are then only
% accessible by first referring  to the package name. Suppose I create a
% directory called '+lab' and put the function 'calc' into this directory.
% I would then call it with the syntax *lab.calc()* .
%
% Packages can provide
% an easy way to organize your code and like private directories, let you
% reuse common function names. You can temporarily import a package,
% (meaning you do not have to use the dot syntax) with the import
% command, i.e. by calling say *import lab* . 
%
% As of 2008b, the only built-in package (that I am aware of) is
% *containers*,
% which contains a class called *map* which implements a hash table.
% Click <dataStructures.html#Containers.map here> for details.
%% Startup File
% You can specify commands to execute every time Matlab starts by creating
% a file on the Matlab search path with the name *startup.m* and writing
% the commands there. On systems running Windows XP, you can store
% the file in a place such as 
% 'C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2008a\bin'.
% For example, my startup.m file contains the following:
%%
cd C:\kmurphy\webMirror\matlabTutorial\source\matlabTutorial
addpath(genpath(pwd))
format compact
dbstop if error
%%
% The first line goes to the specified directory.
% The second line adds all subdirectories below the current one to the
% path.
% The third line reduces the amount of white space used to display
% matlab output.
% The fourth line enters the <debugProfileStyle.html#Debugging debugger> if there is an error.
%
%% Preferences
% Instead of creating a startup.m file, you can edit properties 
% under *File->Preferences*.
% For example, the equivalent of typing 'format compact'
% is to select 
% *File->Preferences->Command Window->Text Display->Numeric
% display->compact*.
% Also, you can edit *File->Set Path* to add directories to your path.
% Once you have edited your path in this way,
% the relevant directories will be automatically 
% added every time you run matlab.
%% Running Matlab in Batch Mode
% Matlab can be run in batch mode, specifying commands for it to execute as
% soon as it begins, with the *-r "command"* switch. Commands are separated
% via semicolons and can be listed directly, or placed in a file with a
% *.m* extension and called like this: *Matlab -r "myscript"*. To write the
% output to a file, include the following switch: *-logfile "logfilename"*.
% If you want Matlab to quit when its finished executing the script, add
% the *exit* command at the end. Make sure Matlab can find the m-file you
% are trying to execute by placing it somewhere on the Matlab path.
% You can get rid of the opening splash screen with *-nosplash* and on unix
% systems bring up a Matlab command window right at the command prompt with
% the *-nodesktop* switch.

%% File Input & Output 
%
% Input and output in Matlab is relatively easy and can be done with a few
% useful functions. We describe these first and show examples at the bottom
% of this section.
%
%% 
% The _dlmread()_ is very useful for importing ascii delimited data into
% Matlab. You simply specify the filename and optionally the delimiter,
% although it can usually figure this out. To write data to a delimited
% file, use the _dlmwrite()_ function. 
%
%%
% You can also use the built in import wizard by typing *uiimport* at the
% command prompt. This is particularly useful when you have data stored in
% the windows clipboard, copied from some third party program. 
%%
% If you are reading text from a file, try the _textscan()_ function. You
% first have to open the file, however, with _fopen()_ and then close it
% when you are done with _fclose()_. You can find an advanced
% worked example
% <StringsCellsStructsSets.html#50 here>.
%%
% To write arbitrary data, including text, to a file, use the _fprintf()_
% function in conjunction with _fopen()_ and _fclose()_: _fopen()_ returns
% a file id, which you then pass as the first argument to _fprintf()_. If
% you do not specify a file id, _fprintf()_ prints the data to the command
% window. We discuss the formatting options available with this function
% <StringsCellsStructsSets.html#11 here>.
%% 
% For more information on, say, the _textscan_ function type *doc textscan*
% at the command prompt.
%%
% Here a a number of examples.
%%
A = rand(20,40);                            % create a random matrix
dlmwrite('testData.csv',A);                 % write to a file as a comma separated list
B = dlmread('testData.csv');                % load it back in
C = 'We will write this string to a file';  % create some text. 
fid = fopen('hello.txt','w');               % open a new file for writing
fprintf(fid,C);                             % write it to a file
fclose(fid);                                % remember to close the file
fid = fopen('hello.txt','r');               % open with read access
D = textscan(fid,'%s');                     % read it back in. %s to expect strings
D{:}                                        % show the contents of D
fclose(fid);                                % remember to close the file.
% You can save and load variables as follows
save example                                % save all the variables to a .mat file
load example                                % load them back in
save('example.mat', 'A', 'B')               % just save speciied variables
clear all
%
%% Input from keyboard
% There are several ways to get interactive input from the user.
% The simplest is the *input* command,
% which gives the user a text prompt

%% Some functions for manipulating file names and directories
% Note that filenames are not allowed to have - (minus sign) in them: 
% use _ (underscore) instead.
% Directories with a @ sign in front of them are private.
% Directories with a + sign in front of them are packages.
% Here are a few useful functions for manipulating filenames.
%%
% Parse a filename
sfile = ['C:/temp','tmp.txt'];
[pathstr, name, ext, versn] = fileparts(sfile)  
%%
% Create a filename from parts in an operating-system neutral way
f = fullfile('c:','windows','temp','myfile.tmp')
%%
% Get  get the file separator for this OS (\ for windows, / for unix)
sep = filesep                                   
%%
% get a struct holding directory info.
dinfo = dir                                   
%%
% display the root Matlab directory
b = matlabroot                 
%%
% list all of the m-files in the current directory
allfiles = what;                 
%%
% check if the specified file exists
exist('writingFunctions','file');   

%% Memory mapped files
% If your datafile is too large to load into memory in one shot,
% you can create a memmapfile object. This will let you access the data
% like a regular array, with standard indexing notation, without having
% to load it all in at once. Instead, parts of the file will be read
% on demand, transparently to you.

% A worked example on how to use this to analyse the CG content of the
% whole human genome can be found
