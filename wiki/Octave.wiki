*General discussion on Matlab vs Octave*

 
[http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ Octave] is a free version of Matlab.
Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages.
The main advantages of Matlab over Octave are that

  * It has much better graphics
  * It has a much better IDE (integrated development environment), including an excellent editor, debugger, and profiler 
  * It is faster than Octave, since it has a just-in-time compiler.
  * It has more functions.

What we usually do is develop code locally in Matlab (using a local site license), exploiting the nice IDE and graphics. But for large compute jobs, which we run on the cloud (such as Amazon's EC2, or [http://www.monkeyanalytics.com/]), we use Octave, so we don't have to worry about licensing issues.


*Compatability of Octave and Matlab*

  * Octave's legend function has a different interface than Matlab's. 

  * Octave sets random seeds differently than Matlab, hence random data is not consistent. 

  * Octave does not yet support Matlab's Object Oriented System and has only limited support for the old style OO system, (e.g. no operator overloading support). 

  * Octave does not support the concatenation of a cell array of strings and a string, you must first wrap the string in a cell. 

{{{
[{'a', 'b'}, 'c'] % works in Matlab, not in Octave
[{'a', 'b'}, {'c'}] % works in both with the same results as above
}}}

  * Vertical concatenation of nested cell arrays of strings, e.g. vertcat(s{:}) behaves differently in Matlab and Octave. Matlab returns a cell array of strings, Octave returns a character array.

  * Calling bsxfun(@eq, a(:), sparse(1:n)) fails in Octave, but works if you omit the call to sparse. 

  * The octave {{{which}}} function behaves slightly differently than Matlab's If you call {{{w = which('foo.m')}}} in Octave while in the same directory as {{{foo.m}}}, octave returns {{{w = '.\foo.m'}}}, whereas Matlab will return the full absolute filepath. This causes problems when calling {{{addpath}}}.

  * The following command fails, (does nothing) in Octave: {{{addpath(genpath(pwd), '-end')}}}. The problem is the {{{'-end'}}} option. 
*Files Missing in Octave*

[http://wiki.octave.org/wiki.pl?MissingMatlabFunctions Here] is a list of files in Matlab 2008a, missing in Octave. 

*Running Octave from within Matlab*

Octave can be launched within the Matlab command window, (useful for development purposes) by using the following code. Add these lines to a Matlab shortcut for single button access. 

{{{ 
addtosystempath('C:\Octave\3.2.3_gcc-4.4.0\bin');
system('octave --traditional --persist --silent -i -p C:\pmtkData --eval addpath(genpath(''C:\pmtk3''))');

}}}

Type {{{ exit() }}} to return to Matlab. 

Code in the Matlab editor can be executed in Octave, (while its running) by highlighting it and pressing the {{{ F9 }}} key.
