#summary Details on updating this tutorial

This tutorial is generated using the Matlab [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/publish.html publish] command. As such the html files should not be modified directly, as these changes will be overwritten if the tutorial is republished. Instead, authorized users should follow these steps. 

  * See this important note on [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/svnMimeTypes svn mime types].


  * Checkout a local copy of the tutorial from the [http://code.google.com/p/yagtom/source/checkout svn repository]. 


  * Make the desired modifications to the .m files in the [http://yagtom.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/source/ source subdirectory]. There is one file per 'chapter'. See [http://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2006/06/07/publishing/ this page] for some markup tips, or type `doc publish` in Matlab. 


  * Change to the yagtom root directory in Matlab and type `publishSource foo` where foo is the name the Matlab file you modified. Typing `publishSource` alone republishes all of the files in the source directory. 


  * Check in the changes. 


The [http://code.google.com/p/yagtom/ root wiki page] is not auto-generated. If you add or remove chapters, this will have to be manually updated.
